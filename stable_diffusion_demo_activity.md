AI Image Generators

# History

2015 - Neural Style Transfer (apply style from one image, to another image)

2014 - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) - generate images from scratch (used to generate novel "photos" of people for example) (fast and creative, but not realistic/low quality)

2015 - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - the most popular way to generate large images until 2021 ( fast, create realistic images, but less "creative")

2021 - Diffusion Models - Good at generating not just photos, but art and images (ex. DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) - generated by test or image prompt (believable and creative - slower, but getting faster)

## How do diffusion models work?

Diffusion models are trained to remove noise from images

"Diffusion models are trained to remove noise from images, so how do we go about doing this? Let's imagine, as an example, that we want to train a diffusion model to create images of cats. We'd start by adding noise to an image of a cat until we could no longer make out the cat. Then, we'd train the model to remove that noise as best we can. When we want to generate a new image, we simply feed our model a bunch of noise and tell it to generate a clean image"

Diffusion models typically follow UNet architecture - UNet architecture determines pixel size (size can be changed by changing architecture, or can feed image into upscaling NN)

# Diffusers Library

https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index

- has diffusion pipelines that can be run in inference mode ([see using diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/using-diffusers/conditional_image_generation))
- see all supported pipelines (https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index#pipelines)
- [Schedulers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/schedulers) (generate noise - speed/quality tradeoff)
- multiple model types can be used in diffusion system (see [models](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/models))
- Training examples - easy to start with **https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/overview**

## Getting started

(Example Code)

```python
# make sure you're logged in with `huggingface-cli login`
from torch import autocast
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", use_auth_token=True)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
with autocast("cuda"):
    image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
```

- Make sure you are logged in (to use authentication token - CC with conditions of AI-generated art disclosure, no use to spread misinformation,etc)

## Schedulers

- allow you to control the denoising process - number of steps, amount of denoising per step, different denoising techniques (effects quality and speed)
    
- one thing that is cool is that we can "look into" the diffusion process to see what is being developed and decide if we want to continue.
    

## Evaluating an Image Generator

There are not as clear of quantitative metrics for evaluating a image generation model performance (visual inspection can be the quickest/best approach).

There are automated evaluation metrics, ex. "Frechet Inception Distance (FID)"- extracts feature vectors from generation and real images, then fit normal distributions to the vectors and compare the distance between means and SDs across the image sets (Lower = better - in the sense that your image is likely more "realistic")

## Ethical considerations

1.  During training, artist work is scraped w/out consent or compensation
2.  Inference can create misleading imagery, imagery can be presented as not ai-generated.

## Notes for introducing project to caicc faculty

https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion

- simpler tutorial: https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_diffusion.ipynb
- Overview of Diffusion process (with imagery)
    We will be using a model hosted on **huggingface**, initially trained with an extremely large dataset (LAION-2B)
    - look at datacard
        - (huggingface is trying to establish best practices around developing, using, and sharing ML models - they have adopted a datacard format that includes licensing details, the datasets and techniques used to train a given model, as well as noted biases, limitations, and energy use)
        - uses the [Machine Learning Impact Calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute)
    - look at files (see components - feature extractor, scheduler, unet- where model is held, see it's post-trained size is only ~3.5gb)
    - look at community (people discussing use and and recommending improvements/changes - huggingface works like github in that it is a repository for code that can be updated and collaborated on - it uses the git protocol just like github)

### STEP 0

- save notebook
- make sure they have a huggingface account and can navigate to find/create at token (with write access)
- consent to terms of model (Scroll and select "Access Repository")

### STEP 1 - Loading Pretrained Model

- need to generate and display 3 more images...
    - replicate prompt line
    - add for loop (save generated images to a list and)
        (you'll notice that running the same code multiple times generates slightly different images)

**4 tweakable options:**

- "latent noise" matrix (you can fix the seed - of randomness, to generate reproducable images, would produce the same image each time, for a given prompt) `latents`
- adjust number of steps taken: `num_inference_steps` (relates to quality)
- prompt (https://www.howtogeek.com/833169/how-to-write-an-awesome-stable-diffusion-prompt/)
- the guidance scale( how closely prompt is followed - ex "creativity") `guidance_scale`
- also - the scheduler (method of denoising image)

### STEP 2 - generating images with more control

#### 2a Set the random seeds

```
- generate random Tensor  (use following code) 
```

```python
generator = torch.Generator() # was getting CPU expected error when using 'cuda' device
tensor1 = torch.randn((1,4,64,64),generator = generator.manual_seed(seed))
tensor2 = torch.randn((1,4,64,64),generator = generator.manual_seed(seed))
# confirm generator produces the same tensor with fixed seed
display(torch.equal(tensor1, tensor2))
# save fixed seed generator for further use
generator_fixed = generator.manual_seed(seed)
```

Then apply fixed generator:

```python
noise_matrix = torch.randn((1,4,64,64),generator = generator.manual_seed(seed))

# run same code again, but include the constant noise_matrix when calling the model pipe
prompt = "a photo of a poodle on an astronaut"
image_list = []
for i in range(2):
  image = (pipe(prompt, latents=noise_matrix).images[0])
  image_list.append(image)
  display(image_list[i])
# you should see two identical images....
# if you share the seed value with someone else, they should be able to replicate your results
```

### Test Replicability

For example, if I give you the seed value of `6421725739674010`
and you plug it into the above code, with this prompt:
`prompt = "a photo of a poodle on an astronaut"`
you should get this exact image:
![e7572411225aced0d74f12ad12454bc8.png](./images/e7572411225aced0d74f12ad12454bc8.png)

#### 2b Test Influence of STEP value

example code:

```python
# add num_inference_steps argument to pipe() function call (increase by 5 each time)
step_images = []
for i in range (20):
    steps = int(5*i+1)
    image = (pipe(prompt, latents=noise_matrix, num_inference_steps = steps).images[0])
    step_images.append(image)
    display(step_images[i])
    display(f"Steps ")
```

# Followup questions

- How do I find a model to use?
    
    - Look at papers and articles demonstrating an interesting application - they will often link to their model if it is hosted on github or huggingface.
    - If you find a model you want to use, see if it has a page / data card on huggingface
        - this will often have demo code and best practices, as well as links to other peoples projects who use this model, so you can see how others apply it.
- How do I learn what parameters I can enter, to manipulate/adjust a pretrained model (for example, the values we tweaked in this demo notebook)
    
    - This is a problem that you will run into when running other peoples' code in general. Recall at the top of the notebook where we installed a bunch of "stuff" - `transformers huggingface_hub diffusers gradio` are all libraries of code that we used throughout the project. We used functions (blocks of pre-written code) from these libraries, and passed them arguments in order for them to do their job (the stuff in the parenthesis).
    - For example, when we ran `from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline` we imported a specific function from the diffusers library (which we installed at the begining) and then used that function in our code.
    - WIth the line `pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4")` we "called" the `StableDiffusionPipeline()` function and specified that we wanted to use an already trained model with `.from_pretrained()` and then gave it a file path string "argument" that it was expecting`"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"` . We "knew" to do this, because the library documentation explains how this function should be used ([From diffusers documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.5.1/en/api/diffusion_pipeline#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline))
    - ![0779a26a9dc2c0dfc067ac97acfd42a3.png](./images/0779a26a9dc2c0dfc067ac97acfd42a3.png)
    - ![071b32462743929f6759aee9eb4ef5a6.png](./images/071b32462743929f6759aee9eb4ef5a6.png)

\- ex. search for `torch.rand()` in https://pytorch.org/docs to understand what the arguments we passed to it actually represent
\- ex. search for  `StableDiffusionPipeline()` in https://huggingface.co/docs to find the same documentation shown above.
\- A library's documentation should always help you determine what arguments you can include when calling a function. It can also help you better define and describe the problem you are having, if you are stuck and need help from others -  by giving you insight into what terminology and methods are being used by a given library (ex. "I am using `StableDiffusionPipeline()` and am trying to define the `guidance_scale` so that my image is tied very closely to the prompt. I see that the documentation recommends larger numbers, but I don't know what the maximum is. What value should I use?")
