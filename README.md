# Week 2 Overview
## Last week
- Read a couple introductions to AI (You Look Like a Think & AI: A Modern Approach)
- Discussed some ML terminology
- Explored an AI app and popular model (AI Dungeon/Transformers)
- Learned about AI/ML & Arts Curriculum at PCC
### Activities:

## This week
[Week 2 Note Document](CAICC_Week_2_Notes.md) - Living Doc
### Tuesday
 - Discussion: You Look Like a Thing reading
 - Activity: Share visualization of basic neural networks
   - Walk through a simple calculation together
 - Diffusion models make Halloween candy: https://www.aiweirdness.com/halloween-candy/
 - Activity: Image generation with stable-diffusion
   - Introduce the concept of prompt engineering
   - Skim this thread for prompt engineering tips https://twitter.com/davidad/status/1551143240065228800
   - And this blog post: https://www.howtogeek.com/833169/how-to-write-an-awesome-stable-diffusion-prompt/amp/
   - Use [huggingface hosted instance](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion) *with filters in place* or https://playgroundai.com
 - Discussion of the ethics of LAION 5B and training on "public" art
### Thursday
-  Reinforcing AI Terminology & Concepts
    - checkpoints
   - pre-trained models
   - linear algebra terms (with examples)
- Discussion: Data Conscience reading
- Introduction to Computer Vision Notebook <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/AI-and-Cultural-Computing/caicc_intensive_week2/blob/main/hello_computer_vision.ipynb\" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in Colab"/></a>

#### If Time Permits
-  Navigating and using ML tools (Colab, Github, Huggingface)
   -  [Activity: Walkthrough of stable-diffusion notebook](stable_diffusion_demo_activity.md)
-  Finding and Sharing Machine Learning Research and Models

### Activities:
- Basic Neural Network Notebook (In Class)
- [Stable Diffusion Image Generation in Colab (Github & Colab Practice)](stable_diffusion_demo_activity.md)
- Share-out Article/Paper of Interest on Slack

### Optional Activities
- [Kaggle Tutorial on Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) - This is a ~5hr tutorial on Python that is slower and more in-depth than the Intro to Python Notebook (optional - helpful for folks that have minimal programming experience)
- [Kaggle Tutorial on Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) - This is a ~3hr tutorial that introduces concepts of Models, Data Collection, and Validation with more fundamental ML models.
