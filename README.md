(Review from Last Week)
  - [Intro to Notebooks notebook](intro_to_notebooks_and_tools.ipynb) - Overview of tools we will be using during the intensive <a href="https://githubtocolab.com/AI-and-Cultural-Computing/caicc_intensive_week1/blob/main/intro_to_notebooks_and_tools.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in Colab"/></a>
  - [Intro to Python](intro_to_python.ipynb) - Light introduction to the most popular programming language for Machine Learning <a href="https://githubtocolab.com/AI-and-Cultural-Computing/caicc_intensive_week1/blob/main/intro_to_python.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in Colab"/></a>


(New Activities)
- [Kaggle Tutorial on Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) - This is a ~5hr tutorial on Python that is slower and more in-depth than the Intro to Python Notebook (optional - helpful for folks that have minimal programming experience)
- [Kaggle Tutorial on Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) - This is a ~3hr tutorial that introduces concepts of Models, Data Collection, and Validation with more fundamental ML models.
